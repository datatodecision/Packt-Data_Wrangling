    "# Milestone 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Details\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset 1:\n",
    "Netflix movies and shows dataset from Kaggle - Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc. This is CSV file downloaded from Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset 2:\n",
    "IMDB's top 250 movie data using web scraping - IMDB ranks movies and given them score. This dataset is published on IMDB website that includes top 250 movies of all time according to them. using Python's Beatifulsoup library to webscrape and json parsing to get the information parsed out to build the dataset. There are 250 movie records.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset 3:\n",
    "Movie Torrents for top 100 monthly movies from Movies, TV, Music, Search, and, Download API -  Movie, TV, music search and download provides API connections to download torrent links for monthly top 100 movies, monthly top 100 tv shows, monthly top 100 music videos, monthly top 100 games torrent etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset 4: \n",
    "Movie details using OMDB API - Getting movie details, actors, awards, DVD release date, Rating Scores from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, box office revenue etc. API returns 25 attributes about a movie. For 250 top movies from IMDB I am calling this API in loop to get details for every movie by passing movie name and the year of release. There are total 250 records.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship between datasets\n",
    "Dataset-4 (OMDB) and dataset-2 (IMDB) we have \"imdb id\" to join on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset-1 (Netflix) and Dataset-3 (Torrent) can be connected on movie title. Need to be careful here as Torrent dataset has more than one record per movie title. I am thinking to get that to one record per movie with an array of torrent links and count of torrents available as derived fields. Doing that grouping by movie titles will bring the Torremt dataset to same granularity level as that of Netflix dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above two resulting datasets can then be connected using \"movie title\" and \"year\". While doing join I will be careful about case of movie titles, any special characters or white spaces, format of year etc to make sure all our join conditions pass and get a corresponding row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Subject Area\n",
    "Project is about analysing details of top movies in the US. Analysis that I am interested in are - \n",
    "1. Distribution of Domestic vs Foreign movies with respect to awards through time\n",
    "2. Most popular genre of movies both domestic and foreign\n",
    "3. Does box office revenue correlates with awards?\n",
    "4. Popularity trend of shows vs movies on Netflix\n",
    "5. Duration trend of movies through time - have movies been shorter through the time?\n",
    "6. Popular movies by numbner of torrents created\n",
    "7. Actors/Actresses by award counts through time\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will it take to accomplish 5 final project milestones?\n",
    "1. Data quality improvement - i.e. outlier detection and remediation, data formatting changes etc.\n",
    "3. Data integration from different sources\n",
    "4. Handling data granularity while joining different data sets together - This may need grouping certain datasets while creating aggregated metrics before joining it to other datasets.\n",
    "5. Establishing connection to the chosen database / RDBMS.\n",
    "6. Creating table(s) to store the data gathered.\n",
    "7. Load the data into tables.\n",
    "8. Create all thought about data visualizations and document the trends, observations etc.\n",
    "9. Capture comments wherever applicable.\n",
    "10. Have saved copies of all datasets at different stages including python scripts with glimpse into data, data base tables, visualizations in python scripts or any visualization tools.\n",
    "11. Push all the changes to GIT repo, provide needed links etc during final submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethical implications and challenges\n",
    "Well, there is a lot of ethical implications that movies have on human mind, his/her development of thoughts, influencing changes in behavior etc. For e.g. some movies show violence in raw form which can leave one distressed and thinking about it for long time. In terms of project at hand any analysis is not an attemp to influence or provide guidance to watch certain types of movies but instead look at the trend and build understanding of this space with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of now I do not see a lot of challenge with this project. Said that data needs to cleaned, integrated, and stored."
